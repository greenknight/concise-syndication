   <abstract>
	   <t>Where-in it is necessary to commit to other parties the existence of a thing, the Concise Syndication is a stream or packet format for the purpose of sharing compactified Universally Unique IDentifiers that may be used as name tokens for further object resolution: concicse syndication provides framing and compactification, and guidelines for well known access patterns for interacting with valid CS names in the web environment.</t>
